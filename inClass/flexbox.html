			<p>And now it’s your birthday on top of everything else. You’ve been dreading it. That’s what you’ve been texting friends for days now: I’m dreading it. Adding a pained emoji face. Xs for eyes, open mouth like an O. Making fun of yourself and your silly dread. But the dread is real. That’s why you’re here in spite of everything. A place you found on the dark web. Open despite the lockdown. A penthouse suite downtown. The dark womb of a treatment room heavy with steam and eucalyptus. The light is so dim and kind. You’re lying naked on a heated table. A woman is kneading your face with some sort of goat placenta. You can feel her knuckles digging deeply into your cheek, draining you of lymphatic fluid. Lots of draining to be done, she says softly. “I’m sure,” you whisper. “Drain away.”</p>

			<p>The woman looked ageless in her black suit, her hair pulled back in a tight bun. Three deep breaths, there you go, she said. I’ll take them with you. Shall I take them with you? She rubbed her hands with essential oil and held them suspended over your nose and mouth. Don’t worry, she said, perhaps sensing your fear, your hesitation. We take every precaution. Well, all right. You breathed deeply together. You felt your chests rise and fall. There, she said. That’s better, isn’t it? You heard a water fountain in the distance. Soft music composed of no instruments you recognized. Like the endless gong of some terrible bell. But beautiful. Now she says: “I’m just going to turn on the light so I can assess your skin. It’s a bright light, so I’ll be covering your eyes.” She presses a damp cotton pad over each of your closed eyelids. You think of pennies on the eyes of the dead. The light’s so bright you can feel it through the cotton. Flaming red. Hot on your face. And the fact of her eyes. Looking at you.</p>

			<p>“Well,” you say at last, because you can’t take any more of her silence. “What’s the verdict?” “You’ve had a difficult year, haven’t you?” You picture yourself alone and afraid in your apartment. Shivering on your island of couch. Body on fire. Breathing as if you were drowning as the tears gushed from your eyes. “Haven’t we all?” you say quietly. She’s silent. The eucalyptus scent is becoming oppressive. “It’s all here, I’m afraid,” she says at last. Her finger pads trace your forehead furrows, the deep creases between your brows. The veins around your nose, the folds around your mouth. Nasolabial folds you found out they were called. Laugh lines that weren’t even born from laughing. She touches it all so tenderly that a tear leaks from your eyes. She lifts the cotton pads from your lids and holds a mirror over your face.</p>

			<p>“Memory and skin go hand in hand,” she says. “Good memories, good skin. Unhappy memories —” and here she trails off. Because the mirror speaks for itself, doesn’t it? “How about we do something about it?” she says in a voice like a caress. And you say, “What?” And she says, “First, I have to ask you: How attached are you to your memories?” You look into the mirror. Your life’s miseries imprinted there on your skin. Your pores gaping open at you like silently screaming mouths. The toll of the past year alone casts a grayness that might never be lifted. And you say to your own reflection: “Not attached. Not attached at all.”</p>

			<p>Now here you are in the bright light of the late summer afternoon. The sun’s still high in the sky, so lovely and golden. There’s a bounce to your step as you skip out of the building. You’re skipping, why not? It’s your birthday after all, isn’t it? Haven’t forgotten that. You wonder what you have forgotten. You think of the woman rubbing those sleek black discs all over your face — those discs attached to electric cables, hooked up to a machine with dials. The woman turned the dials up like volume knobs, and you tasted metal deep in your teeth. It’s funny now to think about how you screamed when you felt electricity crackle along your cranium.</p>
